# mocking-with-mock-server

This project is the demo that belongs to my conference talk "Mocking your microservices with MockServer". 
It includes a demo of using MockServer for testing the game service if the hypothetical application Over-Engineered-Mastermind.
The game-service folder contains the implementation of said sservice.
The component-test folder contains the tests that form the actual demo.
